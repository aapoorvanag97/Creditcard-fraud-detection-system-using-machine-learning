# Creditcard-fraud-detection-system-using-machine-learning
Fraud has been increasing drastically with progression of technology. As
the concept of online shopping as well as virtual money transactions has
gained popularity in the recent days, people use electronic cards on a
daily basis to pay school fees, shopping bills, electricity bills, etc. which
in turn creates an opportunity for hackers to indulge in theft and perform
fraudulent transactions. In our paper, we explain the method of detecting
fraud by Genetic Algorithm to form a well-organized and dependable
payment system. Here, we make use of machine learning techniques to
create clusters of training data and identify the spending profile of the
cardholder. Many approaches are proposed in previous studies to detect
fraud from MasterCard transactions like: supervised, unsupervised, or
hybrid approaches but all of them have their own drawbacks. To
overcome them we have used Neural networks (Back propagation
algorithm) and t-SNE techniques to identify frauds. Our dataset has
transactions made by European credit card holders with 28 features like
credit card number, time of transaction, location etc which is later PCA
transformed. Later Back propagation algorithm is used with one input
layer, three hidden layers and one output layer. Input layer has 28
perceptrons as we have considered 28 different features and the output
layer has 2 perceptrons because the system outputs either 0 or 1 i.e. 0 if it
is a non-fraudulent transaction and 1 if it is a fraudulent transaction. After
plotting the confusion matrix using the predictions made by the ANN
process, the accuracy is found to be 99.99%.
